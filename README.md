LTK is a collection of fundamental and essential codes for lattice QCD simulations, which has been developped by Dr. Atsushi Nakamura.

Numerical simulation is a tool for the research, and the lattice QCD is a tool for hadron physics. He wish many researchers employ the lattice QCD as a useful tool.

But it takes a lot of time and energy to construct the lattice QCD code from scratch. A library form is not appropriate when one wants to perform a new calculation based on a new idea. Then I decided to provide the lattice QCD code as a Tool Kit. You can use any code here as a building block to realize a program for your purpose.
