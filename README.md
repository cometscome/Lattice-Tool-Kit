LTK is a collection of fundamental/essential codes for lattice QCD simulations.

Numerical simulations are a tool for the research, and the lattice QCD is a tool for hadron physics; I wish many researchers employ the lattice QCD as a useful tool.

But it takes a lot of time and energy to construct the lattice QCD code from scratch. A library form is not appropriate when one wants to perform a new calculation based on a new idea. Then I decided to provide the lattice QCD code as a `Tool Kit'. You can use any code here as a building block to realize a program for your purpose.
